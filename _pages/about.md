I am currently a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where my research is guided by a distinguished panel of supervisors:[Dr. Ipek Oguz](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ipek-oguz), [Dr. Yuankai (Kenny) Tao](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/tao-yuankaikenny), and [Dr. Francesca Bagnato](https://www.vumc.org/neurology/person/francesca-bagnato-md-phd). As a member of the [MedICL](https://github.com/MedICL-VU), [Bagnato Lab](https://www.vumc.org/bagnato-lab/person/our-team), and [VISE](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/) research groups, I am deeply engaged in cutting-edge studies at the intersection of ML/DL and medicine. My prior experiences include collaborations with [Dr. Yu-Shin Ding](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/yu-shin-ding) at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine and [Dr. H. Jonathan Chao](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/h-jonathan-chao) at NYU CATT. Additionally, I have had the valuable opportunity to work at the Columbia University Medical Center/[NYSPI](https://nyspi.org/) under the mentorship of Dr. Yunsuo Duan and [Dr. Tommy Vaughan](https://mr.research.columbia.edu/content/john-t-vaughan-jr).

I am deeply engaged in exploring the realms of self and semi-supervised learning within machine and deep learning, specifically tailored to the field of medical imaging. My focus is on advancing generative models capable of effectively learning from imperfect datasets characterized by limited and noisy data. I bring extensive experience in various imaging modalities, including neuroimaging with a focus on multiple sclerosis, PET imaging, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images.

I enjoyed a great time playing tennis, poker and skiing apart from my research. And I have a handsome black Shiba-Inu -- Mochi.

**I am looking for intern positions starting from Summer 2024.**
